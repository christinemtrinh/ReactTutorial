Simple expense tracker app. Through this project I learned the foundations of React:
###### Basics
- components
- props + keys
- JSX expressions
###### State and Events
-  event listeners
-  child-to-parent communication
-  two-way binding
###### Conditional Content
-  outputting stateful lists
-  dynamic charts

## third-react-app
Same project as the second, except the instructor injected minor bugs. Therefore, I learned how to debug by:
- Dissecting the error message
- Tracing the functionality and testing application behavior
- Adding breakpoints through the browser console
- Installing a browser extension called React DevTools

A component is just a JS function.
Ideally have one file per component. This means a full React project could have dozens of components.

App.js tends to be the root component which is rendered in index.js. This means that other components are either nested under App.js or other components.
Can be visualized as a component tree. 
        App
        / \ 
    Header Body
          / | \
          T T T
